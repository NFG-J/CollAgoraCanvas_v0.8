# CollAgoraCanvas_v0.8
(At present) an un-finished electronic workspace for e. g. putting virtual sticker-notes on casnvases like the TBL CC (see  e.g., https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924014212 )

Currently I propose implementing it locally on your machine as a project using e g WebStorm IDE (that will create other needed files) and running it on Chrome.

Issues, known; adapting the window to different Canvas-template sizes. Exporting as picture or PDF.
